# Evenbrite
This project consists of two Python files, link2.py and main.py, which work together to scrape data from music event URLs and save it to a database. Below is a detailed guide on how to use these files.

# Prerequisites
Before using the scraper, make sure you have the following:

Python 3 installed on your machine.
Required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 openpyxl sqlalchemy
# link2.py
The link2.py file is responsible for obtaining the music event URL links and saving them to an Excel file. To use this file, follow the steps below:

Open the link2.py file in a text editor or Python IDE.

Modify the BASE_URL variable to the website URL where the music event links are located. For example:

python
Copy code


Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python link2.py
This will scrape the music event URL links and save them to an Excel file named music_event_links.xlsx.

# main.py
The main.py file is used to scrape data from the music event URLs obtained from the previous step and save it to a database. To use this file, follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have the music_event_links.xlsx file generated from the previous step in the same directory as main.py.

Open the main.py file in a text editor or Python IDE.

Run the script using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will scrape data from the music event URLs stored in music_event_links.xlsx and save it to the specified database table.

# Conclusion
By following the steps outlined above, you can scrape music event data from URLs and store it in a database using the link2.py and main.py scripts respectively. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your specific needs.
